# ConsoleApp 〜Hit And Blow〜

## Rule
- This is a game to guess 3-digit numbers made by a personal computer.
- You enter three numbers
- If the numbers and location match, HIT will be counted.
- If the numbers are correct but in the wrong place, BLOW will be counted.
- (Example) If computer is 「014」and you enter 「412」,
- HIT is 1 because 「1」 matches the number and the location.
- 「4」 have the same number, but the location is different, so BLOW is 2.
